-- Difference Between Document and Window Objects --

In the realm of web development, understanding the Document Object Model (DOM) is paramount. It forms the foundation of creating dynamic and interactive web pages. 
Two fundamental objects within the DOM are the Document object and the Window object. These objects play distinct roles in manipulating and interacting with web content, 
but they are often confused due to their interconnected nature.

Document Object: Navigating the Web Content :
The Document object is at the core of the DOM and represents the entire web page or document. It serves as an interface to access and manipulate the content within an HTML or XML document. 
The Document object provides a structured representation of the web page's elements, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and forms. 
Developers can interact with these elements using various methods and properties provided by the Document object.

Key features of the Document object include:
1. getElementById(): This method allows developers to access an HTML element using its unique ID attribute.
2. querySelector() and querySelectorAll(): These methods permit the selection of elements using CSS selectors, offering flexibility in DOM traversal.
3. createElement() and appendChild(): Developers can dynamically create new elements and append them to the DOM using these methods.
4. innerHTML and textContent: These properties enable the manipulation of the content within HTML elements.

Window Object: Managing the Browser Window :
The Window object represents the browser window or tab in which a web page is displayed. It serves as a global object for the JavaScript runtime environment, 
allowing developers to control various aspects of the browser window and interact with the user interface. Unlike the Document object, which primarily deals with the content of the web page, 
the Window object focuses on managing the browser itself.

Key features of the Window object include:
1. window.open(): This method is used to open new browser windows or tabs, offering control over the window's dimensions and appearance.
2. window.location: Developers can use this property to manage the current URL of the browser window, enabling navigation to different web pages.

Document vs. Window: A Clarified Perspective :
While the Document and Window objects serve distinct purposes, it's important to note their interconnected nature. The Document object is essentially a property of the Window object. 
This means that you can access the Document object using the 'document' property of the Window object. For instance, you might often see code snippets like window.document.getElementById("myElement").

In essence, the Document object is focused on the content and structure of the web page, providing methods to manipulate its elements, whereas the Window object takes care of browser-related actions and interactions.
